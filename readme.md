# mdoc [Mâ†“]

GitHub markdown documentation generator for Objective-C

Comments in header files with three slashes(///) or block comments that start with two asterisks(/**) are collected up then dumped out for each method. These comments may also contain markdown.

The command line takes two arguments, the first is the directory to recursivly search for header files. The second is the readme file to write the markdown to. The second argument is optional, if it's left off the markdown will be written to stdout.

    python mdoc.py [project root] [output readme]

Two examples of mdoc being used in the wild are on [BBlock](https://github.com/kgn/BBlock) and [KGLib](https://github.com/kgn/KGLib).
